# Handwritten Digit Recognition Application

- Constructed an application that provides machines the ability to recognize different human handwritten digits, which can be used to detect vehical numbers, read bank cheques, arrange post letters and more.
- Utlized one of the most effective algorithms for this particular problem, a Convolutional Neural Network, and trained and tested it using a total of 70,000 (28x28) pixel images of handwritten numbers from the MNIST Dataset.
- Built a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for pratical use of the model using Keras to take a drawn digit on the interactive canvas to indentify the digit.
